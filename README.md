# htmlswf

## About
* Embeds a .swf (flash) file into a .html (HTML) file and runs it in your default browser. For Mac, Linux, and Windows!
* Status: Working
* Maintainer: Angad Tendulkar <angad.tendulkar@gmail.com>

## Install/Use
* Put the htmlswf file somewhere in your PATH
* Run any .swf with the htmlswf file (Right Click > Run With > htmlswf)
* Windows Users may need to use B2E (Bat2Exe) or similar software to use htmlswf, but you will need to test it because I do not use windows or mac for programming

## Usage
* If you really want to run it with the command line, you need the absolute path of the .swf.
Linux, Mac
```sh
htmlswf /home/****/path/to/file.swf
```

Windows
```
.\htmlswf.bat C:\Users\****\path\to\file.swf
```
